  user_query: What is lmoe?
  agent_response: Layered Mixture of Experts. Typically 'mixture of experts' is a tuned model made up of several sub-models which will contribute partially to a response depending on the input. lmoe is using the term to mean a distinct model which classifies various other distinct models as experts, and connects them in a directed, acyclic graph to produce a response.
